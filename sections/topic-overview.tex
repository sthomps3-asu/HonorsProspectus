\section{Topic Overview:}

\indent Low-power wearable systems that are capable of continous image capture can provide portable analysis of the subject's motion
through space and time. This motion analysis can provide a valuable data set to physicians that are working to with patients undergoing
physical rehabilitation for mobility disorders. Image capture sequences are inherently inflexible and power-hungry due to the static
framerate that is set prior to a capture sequence. Continously sensing with a constant framerate to obtain an appreciable level of
resolution is taxing on the energy systems of the image sensing device. Such demanding energy requirements make continous image sensing
impractical for compact wearable devices. Enabling embedded computer vision devices to operate with variable framerates during continous
image sensing will provide energy efficiency as well as dynamicaly variable spatiotemporal resolution.
