\section{Meetings:}
\indent Weekly meetings will be conducted between myself and Dr. LiKamWa to discuss progress and important issues as they arise.
These meetings will also be used to review firmware implementations and address design philosophies and techniques. I will meet
with Dr. Turaga bi-weekly or monthly to discuss the project and to learn from his expertise in computer vision.
